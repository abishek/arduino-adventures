# UNTA Bot

This is the project that I have been wanting to do for over a decade. I have built multiple smaller variations leading up to this. I am calling it Unta bot - we call our son Unta. I hope my doing this will inspire him to do better things himself.
 
 The idea is a simple robotic platform that can move around freely in the house with some level of obstacle avoidance built into it. The first cut is simply a bluetooth controlled bot. I have used HM-10 as my BLE module of choice. The basic controller is the Arduino Uno. This current code is able to receive commands over BLE and move. I need to tune the durations to get precise turns.
 
 ### Coming Soon
 
 -[ ] Add wiring diagram
 -[ ] Add details on the motor controller
